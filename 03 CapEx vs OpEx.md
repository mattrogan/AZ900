# CapEx vs OpEx

## Objectives
* Describe the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

---

How you approach financing your system is determined by whether you use CapEx or OpEx.

## CapEx (Capital Expenditure)
This approach is focused on making a **large initial investment** to your system and paying small maintenance costs as time goes on. 

Consider a business starting up:
* They pay a large investment for all their own servers, equipment, maintenance staff, &c.
* They have everything they need for their business to run
* For servers, they need to _grow to capacity_
* For any maintenance, there are costs associated over time to fix things. **This is handled on-premise**.
* You will see a depreciation of value overtime, because you are using more capacity & have less left.

## OpEx (Operational Expenditure)
This approach, alternatively, is focused on **renting what you need as opposed to outright buying it**. This could be purchasing infrastructure and services from Microsoft, for example.
* You pay **no upfront costs**. It's all about renting what you need.
* You delegate a small team to handling any local maintenance; the service provider will do most of the maintenance work.
* Costs are ongoing based on your usage... but you _only pay for what you use_.
* This will have no change in value over time.

# Part 1b: More cloud benefits

## Objectives:
* Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
* Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
* Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

## Reliability and Predictability

In the first part, we touched on the metric of **Availability** (uptime) for a system.

> High availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for a system.
>
> We calculate the 'availability' of a system using:
> 
> $ {Availability} = \frac{Uptime}{Uptime + Downtime} $

### Reliability
> **Reliability** is a measure of how well a service (or a product as part of the service) performs its function(s).

Of course: if a product is doing what it should and doing it well, it is reliable! In a cloud computing context, this is also the ability to perform the required functions:
1. Under certain stated conditions
2. For a specified period of time

### Predictability
> Predictability is how close the actual performance of the system is to expectations

We will, of course, have expectations for how our system should perform. A cloud solution should be able to meet the expectations of its customers, who expect it to perform well in terms of both reliability - but also predictability!

* You should be able to predict how well your solution will perform
* You should also be able to assess the impacts of the aforementioned on your business

Naturally, if your system is more predictable, the more you'll be able to adapt to any change in requirements or customers' needs.

## Security and Governance
We also need to be able to consider the security of our solution(s), and our governance over them.

In general, these two are better managed by a cloud provider than an on-premises solution. This makes sense!
* With a Microsoft cloud solution, your system is more secure because it's a shared environment. This means it's harder for hackers to access and gain your data
* Additionally, you can govern your solution better with the Cloud - it is accessible from anywhere!
* Unauthorized activity can be logged and tracked easily in the Cloud - particularly compared to on-premises solutions! If it's tracked to a certain individuals, the leverage and permissions they have can be revoked/frozen as needed.

## Manageability
Benefits of manageability are a priority when considering a cloud-based solution! Data centers are, of course, costly to operate and maintain, so by using the cloud we are solving these issues by eliminating the onus on yourself to solve the problem.

There are many benefits of manageability when using cloud computing:
* You don't have to manage your own data centers.
* If you require more capacity, you can request more resources
* ...where you only pay for what you use! (See: [consumption-based model](./04%20Consumption%20Based%20Model.md))
* You have several options for data storage e.g. NoSQL or Relational databases
* You have consistency across a hybrid environment and can enable governance at a scale

## Some general cloud benefits
Two more general benefits of using the cloud:

1. By using the cloud, you can save money, time and enable scalability.

2. You can save money and time by not having to buy or maintain your own data centers.
